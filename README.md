# GraphVision

Github repository for the Final project for CS GY 6953 Deep Learning

Our experiments are grouped into three categories and can be found in their respective directory:
* `GENConv`
* `GeneralConv`
* `GATConv`

Within each category, we listed notebooks corresponding to experiments arranged by
* the number of layers, such as `4`, `8`, `16`, and `32`
* the hidden dimension, such as `128` and `256`
* learning rates, such as `0.01` (the default) and `0.001`
